APEX is the payment dataset encompassing all payments made by the USPS. Each row is a line amount on an invoice paid by the USPS to a contractor. A single invoice can have line amounts for multiple contracts, and a single contract can have multiple invoices. 


CAMS is the Contract Asset Management System. Each row contains information specific to one modification to a USPS contract. Each contract can have multiple modifications.

The data went through an intensive cleaning process. The details of this process can be found in the appendix.

The two tables were merged together to make a master list of all contracts and variables. CAMS is the master list of contracts we would like to include in our universe. Any contracts with data on APEX not found on CAMS are removed and not considered in the model.

3. If  “PortFolioName” equals “Facilities Portfolio”, discard the record.
4. If  “PortFolioName” equals “Transportation Portfolio” and “PONumberConformed”
length is less than 12, discard the record. 
5. If “Product_Desc” when made lowercase and stripped of spaces equals “contract postal unit” “retail distribution services”, discard the record.
6. Change missing values denoted “?,? ?”, “?”, and “!” to a single space in fields “Buyer_Name”, “COR_Name”, “AwdModTypeDesc”, “ContactName”, “CO_Name”, “Requestor_Name”, “IssuingOfficeCode”, “ACOName”, “ProcurementTypeDesc”, and
“PrimaryProductServiceCode”.
7. If TIN equals “FOREIGN” or “9000000009”, use TIN imputation process. (There are potentially other obviously bogus TIN’s that could be found)
8. Trim and make uppercase “EDW_Supplier” and “CAMS_TIN_Xref.CAMS_Supplier_NAME”.
9. Filter out field “PrimaryProductServiceCode”.
10. Merge “IT Purchase Records.xlsx” based on “PONumberConformed”. This provides
a flag for whether a contract supplies IT services. 
11. Replaces blanks on “CAMS_PO_with_IT_Ind.ITPurchaseFlag with “N”.
12. If “HeaderStatusDesc” equals “Closed” and “PerformanceEndDate” is before January
2008, discard the record.
13. Rename field “CAMS_TIN_Xref.CAMS_Supplier_NAME” to “SupplierName”.
(This is the supplier name field that gets used.)

10. Merge IT Purchase Records.xlsx based on PONumberConformed. This provides

CAMS is really a flattend export from a database.

We can see that CAMS is Tall if we are interested in Contracts. We do not have one contract per row.
