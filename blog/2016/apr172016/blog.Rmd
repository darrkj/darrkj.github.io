```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

A few interesting packages that are newish to me.

The first of which is called feather.
It stems from the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) project and makes it super fast to read datafiles in R.


The process which this uses seems rather intutive as to why it works better.

```{r}
# devtools::install_github("dgrtwo/fuzzyjoin")
# devtools::install_github("hadley/tibble")
# devtools::install_github("wesm/feather/R")
# devtools::install_github("hadley/readr")

library(feather)
library(readr)
library(data.table)
library(fuzzyjoin)
library(tibble)
library(dplyr)
```

This data can be found [here](https://datahub.io/dataset/us-airline-on-time-performance/resource/37834910-8634-45a9-aed4-9d59dac7f1d6).
```{r eval = F}

# data source
# 

system.time(x <- read.csv('2008.csv'))
#   user  system elapsed
# 96.721   2.850  99.914

write_feather(x, '2008.feather')

rm(x);gc();
system.time(x <- read_feather('2008.feather'))
#   user  system elapsed
# 0.765   0.396   1.162

rm(x);gc();
system.time(x <- read_csv('2008.csv'))
#  user  system elapsed 
# 15.345   1.413  18.642

rm(x);gc();
system.time(x <- fread('2008.csv'))
#  user  system elapsed 
# 6.923   0.374   7.302

```






Another useful package is tibble. Normally I start all of my code with by turning strings to factors as FALSE, becuase if I don't 15 minutes later I have to figure out why something that should be easy is not working. I modify this option then re-reun everything I am good to go, except that my train of thought was derailed pretty hard.

I have also never been a fan of the odd process of creating a throw away data.frame.

```{r}
throw_away <- data.frame(a = c(1, 2, 3), b = c('a', 'b', 'c'))
str(throw_away)

rbind(throw_away, c(1, 'd'))
```
That was in no way what you would expect to happen.

The tibble method to construct a dataset is very similar to SAS or Matlab, whcih is clean. And most of all it does not make anything into a factor for me.
```{r}
a <- tibble::frame_data(
  ~x, ~y,  ~z,
  "a", 2,  3.6,
  "b", 1,  8.5,
  "c", 1,  8.5,
  "D", 1,  8.5)

```


What if I wanted to join this data onto another set.
```{r fuzzy}
a %>% select(x) %>%
  stringdist_inner_join(., ., max_dist = .5, by = 'x') %>%
  filter(x.x != x.y)

a %>% select(x) %>%
  stringdist_inner_join(., ., max_dist = .5, by = 'x') %>%
  filter(x.x != x.y)

head(iris)
sepal_lengths <- data_frame(Sepal.Length = c(5, 6, 7), Type = 1:3)

iris %>%
  difference_inner_join(sepal_lengths, max_dist = .5)
```



```{r}
#library(prompt)
#set_prompt(prompt_fancy)
5
4

```

```{r}
library(alexr)
alex(file("blog.Rmd"))

alex(file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/darrkj/darrkj.github.io/master/blog/2015/dec012015/index.html"))
