Goal: Can you cluster the time series of the score in an NBA game into certain
  types of wins and losses. Come from behind wins, last second wins, blowouts,
  shootouts, etc.

Data: Need to scrape data from the web.


Scape.R
Clean.R
Analysis.R

Two problems have came about in the past. When scraping data I have had many ideas on the same type of data. The scrapers have been rewritten to collect the data just a little differently each time so that a new type of analysis can be done. This leads to a few problems. The biggest is that you can't go back and create the data again. It seems that it may be easier to break each piece into its own folder/project. Then the problem turns into having a large portion of code shared in many places with small tweakes to clean the data differently. What seems to be the root of the problem is collecting the data in a specific manner. Should collect it with no changes made, then in each area of use clean it for its specific purpose.

Never create a variable without a good name, x, h and g are the worst names ever. Do not save data into a file with a bad name.
